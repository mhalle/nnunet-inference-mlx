# Changelog

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- `progress: bool = False` parameter on `InferenceEngine` and on the three sliding-window functions (`predict_sliding_window`, `predict_sliding_window_streaming`, `predict_sliding_window_segmentation`). When `True`, a tqdm progress bar is shown for each patch processed during inference. Mirrors the equivalent bar that nnUNetPredictor shows on the PyTorch path.
- `tqdm` is now a runtime dependency (small, pure Python).

### Fixed
- The MLX inference path was missing a per-patch progress bar that the PyTorch/MPS path through `nnUNetPredictor` has always shown. Long inference runs now have visible progress feedback when the caller passes `progress=True`. The corresponding `mlx_predict.py` wrapper in TotalSegmentator now passes `progress=not quiet` to enable the bar by default.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- `ModelBundle` and `InferenceEngine` are now separate classes — bundles hold weights/plans/dataset, engines hold inference-time configuration. Construct each independently or use `InferenceEngine(ModelBundle.from_task(...))`.
- Streaming sliding-window accumulator: rolling Z-direction buffer keeps memory bounded for large volumes. Skipped automatically when the volume fits in a single accumulator.
- `softmax_inplace` helper for converting logits to probabilities without an extra copy.
- `convert_pth_to_safetensors` public helper for one-shot conversion of legacy PyTorch checkpoints to the canonical layout.

### Changed
- **Adopt the nnU-Net canonical safetensors layout as the only on-disk format.** Files now live at `<base>.safetensors` (PyTorch-layout tensors with a `weight_layout=torch_ncdhw` metadata header), matching what `nnUNetTrainer` writes natively after the upstream safetensors PR. Models trained with new nnU-Net drop onto a Mac and load with no conversion step.
- The loader transposes conv weights at load time using `safetensors.numpy` (no torch round-trip). Runtime stays torch-free.
- `convert_model_folder` and the convert CLI now write the canonical layout directly. Output is byte-identical in shape and tagging to `nnUNetTrainer`'s native output.
- Package renamed from internal references to `nnunet-inference-mlx`; TotalSegmentator-specific defaults and hardcoding removed from `ModelBundle` and `InferenceEngine`. The package no longer assumes any particular weights directory.
- `nnUNet_results` environment variable is consulted before falling back to TotalSegmentator's default location.
- Metal cache limit set to 30% of system RAM by default for better large-volume behavior.

### Removed
- Legacy `<base>_mlx.safetensors` (MLX-pre-transposed) format. Existing files become orphaned and can be deleted; auto-conversion handles re-generation from `.pth` on first call.
- `save_weights_safetensors` and the `WEIGHT_LAYOUT_MLX` constant (unused after the rewrite).
- Hardcoded `Task` enum for TotalSegmentator model IDs.
- Source-layout fallback hint on `load_weights_safetensors`. The loader now requires the metadata header and rejects untagged files with an actionable error.

### Fixed
- Tests in `test_engine.py` use plain asserts instead of `return bool`, eliminating `PytestReturnNotNoneWarning`.

### Migration
- Pre-existing `_mlx.safetensors` files are no longer read. Delete them and let `ModelBundle.from_task` auto-convert from `.pth` on the next call (one-time torch dependency at conversion time only).
- Code that imported `save_weights_safetensors` should switch to `convert_pth_to_safetensors`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- Replace custom `_AvgPool3d` with built-in `mlx.nn.AvgPool3d` in residual encoder blocks.
- Bump minimum MLX version from 0.22 to 0.25 (adds native 3D pooling, 3D conv speedups).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-04-14

Initial release: MLX inference backend for nnU-Net on Apple Silicon.
